Dockerfile to create a container for ARM32v7 CPU
ends the CPUcore temperature of a Allwinner H3 (like NanopPi Neo) via MQTT to a broker every minute
(to be used in OpenHAB for example)

create environment file containing:
MQTTBROKER=<hostname of your broker>
MQTTPORT=1883
MQTTBASE=<MQTT Base Path>
MQTTPARAMETER=<other Parameters or empty>

start with:
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --name arm32v7-h3-mqtt-cpulipo -h <container-hostname> --env-file <path-to-env-file> intrepidde/arm32v7-h3-mqtt-cpulipo:latest
or
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --name arm32v7-h3-mqtt-cpulipo --uts="host" --env-file <path-to-env-file> intrepidde/arm32v7-h3-mqtt-cpulipo:latest

Add "-v <local path>:<container path>" to command line (example: "-v /etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs"),
in env file MQTTPARAMETER="--cafile /etc/ssl/certs/<your ca-file> --tls-version tlsv1.1"
and change port to 8883

based on: arm32v7/debian:latest using mosquitto_pub
